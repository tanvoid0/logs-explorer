# Terminal Freezing Fix

## Problem
The original terminal implementation was freezing the entire application when running commands because it used blocking I/O operations. The `execute_command` function would wait for the entire command to complete before returning any output, causing the UI to become unresponsive.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Rust backend implementation:
- Used `.output()` which waits for the entire process to complete
- No real-time streaming of command output
- UI would freeze until command finished

## Solution
Implemented a non-blocking, real-time streaming terminal solution inspired by the terminux project:

### Backend Changes (Rust)
1. **New `execute_command_live` function** in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`:
   - Uses `Command::spawn()` instead of `.output()`
   - Reads stdout/stderr in real-time using `BufReader`
   - Emits output lines via Tauri events (`command_output`)
   - Returns final result after process completion

2. **Real-time event emission**:
   - Each line of output is immediately sent to the frontend
   - Uses `window.emit("command_output", line)` for streaming
   - Frontend receives output as it's generated

### Frontend Changes (Svelte)
1. **New `NonBlockingTerminal.svelte` component**:
   - Listens for `command_output` events in real-time
   - Updates UI immediately as output arrives
   - Maintains responsive interface during command execution
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners

2. **Event-driven architecture**:
   - Uses `listen('command_output', callback)` for real-time updates
   - Converts ANSI codes to HTML for proper display
   - Shows running indicator during command execution

## Key Features
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during command execution
- ✅ **Real-time output**: See command output as it's generated
- ✅ **ANSI support**: Proper color and formatting support
- ✅ **Error handling**: Graceful error handling and display
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Proper event listener cleanup on component destruction

## Usage
The new terminal is automatically used in project pages. It provides:
- Framework-specific command buttons
- Package.json script detection
- Real-time command output
- Clear visual indicators for running commands

## Technical Details
- **Event System**: Uses Tauri's event system for real-time communication
- **Streaming**: Processes output line-by-line instead of waiting for completion
- **Memory Efficient**: Doesn't buffer entire command output in memory
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Migration
The old `SimpleTerminal` component has been replaced with `NonBlockingTerminal` in the project pages. The old component can be removed once testing confirms the new implementation works correctly.

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run a long-running command (e.g., `ping google.com`)
2. Verify the UI remains responsive
3. Check that output appears in real-time
4. Confirm the app doesn't crash or freeze
