# Automation Pipeline System

The Logs Explorer application now includes a powerful automation pipeline system that allows you to create, manage, and execute YAML-based automation workflows for your projects. This system is inspired by GitHub Actions and Jenkins, providing a flexible and extensible way to automate common development tasks.

## Features

### üéØ **Pipeline Management**
- **Visual Pipeline Editor**: Create and edit pipelines using an intuitive visual interface
- **YAML-based Configuration**: Pipelines are stored in YAML format for version control and portability
- **Template System**: Use pre-built templates for common workflows (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Framework-specific Pipelines**: Create pipelines that are specific to certain frameworks or technologies

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Engine**
- **Step-by-step Execution**: Execute pipeline steps sequentially or in parallel
- **Dependency Management**: Define step dependencies to control execution order
- **Conditional Execution**: Run steps based on conditions (e.g., framework type, environment)
- **Timeout and Retry Logic**: Configure timeouts and automatic retries for robust execution

### üìä **Progress Tracking**
- **Real-time Progress**: Monitor pipeline execution with live progress indicators
- **Step-level Tracking**: Track individual step progress and status
- **Execution History**: View past executions and their results
- **Logging and Output**: Capture and display step output and logs

### üîß **Variable System**
- **Runtime Variables**: Automatically provided variables (PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_PATH, etc.)
- **Custom Variables**: Define your own variables with validation and defaults
- **Environment Variables**: Set step-specific environment variables
- **Variable Substitution**: Use variables in commands and scripts

### üõ°Ô∏è **Validation and Security**
- **Pipeline Validation**: Validate pipeline syntax and dependencies before execution
- **Input Validation**: Validate variable inputs with patterns and constraints
- **Security Checks**: Safe execution environment with proper isolation

## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the Automation System

    defaultValue: my-app
    required: true
```

### 4. Defining Steps

Steps are the actions your pipeline performs:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: install-deps
    name: Install Dependencies
    type: command
    command: npm install
    workingDirectory: .
    timeout: 300
    
  - id: run-tests
    name: Run Tests
    type: command
    command: npm test
    dependsOn: [install-deps]
    timeout: 120
```

## Step Types

### Command Steps
Execute shell commands:
```yaml
- id: build
  name: Build Application
  type: command
  command: npm run build
  workingDirectory: ./frontend
  timeout: 300
```

### Script Steps
Execute custom scripts:
```yaml
- id: data-processing
  name: Process Data
  type: script
  scriptType: python
  script: |
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    # Process data...
  timeout: 600
```

### Validation Steps
Validate conditions:
```yaml
- id: check-coverage
  name: Check Test Coverage
  type: validation
  validation:
    type: command_success
    value: "npm run test:coverage"
    message: "Test coverage must be above 80%"
```

### Wait Steps
Add delays or wait for conditions:
```yaml
- id: wait-deployment
  name: Wait for Deployment
  type: wait
  timeout: 300
```

### Notification Steps
Send notifications:
```yaml

    name: Integration Tests
    type: command
    command: npm run test:integration
    dependsOn: [unit-tests]
    condition: TEST_ENV === "integration"
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Execution
Use conditions to run steps only when certain criteria are met:
```yaml
- id: deploy-staging
  name: Deploy to Staging
  type: command
  command: kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
  condition: BUILD_ENV === "staging"
```

### Parallel Execution
Run steps in parallel by setting `parallel: true`:
```yaml
- id: test-unit
  name: Unit Tests
  type: command
  command: npm run test:unit
  parallel: true
  
- id: test-integration
  name: Integration Tests
  type: command
  command: npm run test:integration
  parallel: true
```

### Step Dependencies
Control execution order with dependencies:
```yaml
- id: step1
  name: Step 1
  type: command
  command: echo "Step 1"
  
- id: step2
  name: Step 2
  type: command
  command: echo "Step 2"
  dependsOn: [step1]
  
- id: step3
  name: Step 3
  type: command
  command: echo "Step 3"
  dependsOn: [step1, step2]
```

### Environment Variables
Set step-specific environment variables:
```yaml
- id: build
  name: Build with Environment
  type: command
  command: npm run build
  environment:
    NODE_ENV: production
    BUILD_VERSION: ${PIPELINE_ID}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pipeline Design
- **Keep pipelines focused**: Each pipeline should have a single responsibility
- **Use meaningful names**: Clear, descriptive names for pipelines and steps
- **Add descriptions**: Document what each pipeline and step does
- **Version your pipelines**: Use semantic versioning for pipeline changes

### 2. Variable Management
- **Use descriptive variable names**: Make variables self-documenting
- **Provide defaults**: Set sensible default values for variables
- **Validate inputs**: Use validation rules for critical variables
- **Document variables**: Add descriptions for all variables

### 3. Step Organization
- **Logical grouping**: Group related steps together
- **Clear dependencies**: Explicitly define step dependencies
- **Error handling**: Include validation and error-checking steps
- **Timeout configuration**: Set appropriate timeouts for each step

### 4. Security Considerations
- **Validate inputs**: Always validate user inputs and variables
- **Limit permissions**: Run steps with minimal required permissions
- **Sanitize commands**: Avoid executing user-provided commands directly
- **Log sensitive data**: Be careful not to log sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pipeline not appearing in project**
   - Check if the pipeline framework matches the project framework
   - Ensure the pipeline is saved and active

2. **Step execution fails**
   - Check the step logs for error messages
   - Verify the command or script syntax
   - Ensure required dependencies are available

3. **Variable substitution not working**
   - Use `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax for variable substitution
   - Ensure variables are defined and have values
   - Check for typos in variable names

4. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase the timeout value for long-running steps
   - Consider breaking complex steps into smaller ones
   - Check if the step is waiting for external resources

### Getting Help

- Check the step logs for detailed error messages
- Review the pipeline validation results
- Test individual steps manually to isolate issues
- Use the pipeline editor's validation features
