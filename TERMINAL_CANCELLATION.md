# Command Cancellation Feature

## Overview
Added the ability to stop running commands in the terminal, similar to Ctrl+C functionality in traditional terminals.

## Features Implemented

### üîß **Backend (Rust)**
1. **Process Tracking**: 
   - Global storage for running processes using `RUNNING_PROCESSES` HashMap
   - Each process is tracked by its PID for cancellation

2. **New `cancel_command` function**:
   - Kills all running processes
   - Clears the process storage
   - Returns success/error status

3. **Enhanced `execute_command_live`**:
   - Stores spawned processes in global storage
   - Removes processes when they complete naturally
   - Enables cancellation during execution

### üé® **Frontend (Svelte)**
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - **Ctrl+C**: Cancels the currently running command
   - Only active when a command is running
   - Prevents default browser behavior

2. **Visual Indicators**:
   - **Stop Button**: Red "Stop (Ctrl+C)" button appears when command is running
   - **Status Messages**: Clear feedback when command is cancelled
   - **Running Indicator**: Green pulsing dot shows active command

3. **User Experience**:
   - Immediate visual feedback
   - Clear cancellation messages
   - Responsive UI during cancellation

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Press **Ctrl+C** while a command is running
- Command will be immediately terminated
- Status message will appear: "‚ö†Ô∏è Command cancelled by user (Ctrl+C)"

### Button Interface
- Click the red **"Stop (Ctrl+C)"** button in the terminal header
- Same functionality as keyboard shortcut
- Visual confirmation of cancellation

## Technical Implementation

### Process Management
```rust
// Global storage for running processes
static RUNNING_PROCESSES: Lazy<Mutex<HashMap<u32, std::process::Child>>> = 
    Lazy::new(|| Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));

// Cancel all running processes
#[tauri::command]
fn cancel_command() -> Result<(), String> {
    let mut processes = RUNNING_PROCESSES.lock().unwrap();
    
    for (pid, child) in processes.iter_mut() {
        println!("Cancelling process with PID: {}", pid);
        if let Err(e) = child.kill() {
            println!("Failed to kill process {}: {}", pid, e);
        }
    }
    
    processes.clear();
    Ok(())
}
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Keyboard event listener
const handleKeydown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'c' && isRunning) {
    event.preventDefault();
    cancelCommand();
  }
};

// Cancellation function
async function cancelCommand() {
  if (!isRunning) return;
  
  try {
    await invoke('cancel_command');
    output += '\n‚ö†Ô∏è Command cancelled by user (Ctrl+C)\n';
    isRunning = false;
    currentCommand = '';
  } catch (error) {
    output += `\n‚ùå Error cancelling command: ${error}\n`;
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **User Control**
- Stop long-running commands that are taking too long
- Cancel commands that are stuck or hanging
- Immediate response to user input

### ‚úÖ **Better UX**
- Familiar Ctrl+C shortcut (standard terminal behavior)
- Visual feedback for cancellation
- No app freezing during command execution

### ‚úÖ **Resource Management**
- Proper cleanup of running processes
- Prevents zombie processes
- Memory efficient process tracking

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Long-running command**: Run `ping google.com` and cancel with Ctrl+C
2. **Hanging command**: Run a command that gets stuck and cancel it
3. **Multiple commands**: Start multiple commands and cancel them
4. **Button vs Keyboard**: Test both the button and keyboard shortcut

### Expected Behavior
- Commands should stop immediately when cancelled
- Status message should appear in terminal output
- UI should remain responsive during cancellation
- No error messages should appear for successful cancellations

## Integration
The cancellation feature is fully integrated with the existing non-blocking terminal:
- Works with all framework commands
- Compatible with package.json scripts
- Supports custom commands
- Maintains real-time output streaming

## Future Enhancements
- **Selective cancellation**: Cancel specific commands instead of all
- **Process tree killing**: Kill child processes as well
- **Graceful shutdown**: Send SIGTERM before SIGKILL
- **Cancellation history**: Track cancelled commands
